## Database Schema

### New Columns Added

**application_questions table**:
- `template_file_id` (UUID, nullable) - References files table for downloadable templates
- `show_if_question_id` (UUID, nullable) - References another question for conditional logic
- `show_if_answer` (TEXT, nullable) - Answer value that triggers showing this question
- Indexes on `template_file_id` and `show_if_question_id` for performance

### Migration Files

**004_add_question_template_files.sql**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE application_questions
ADD COLUMN template_file_id UUID REFERENCES files(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_questions_template_file ON application_questions(template_file_id);
```

**005_add_profile_picture_type.sql**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE application_questions
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS application_questions_question_type_check;

ALTER TABLE application_questions
ADD CONSTRAINT application_questions_question_type_check
CHECK (question_type IN (
  'text', 'textarea', 'dropdown', 'multiple_choice',
  'file_upload', 'checkbox', 'date', 'email', 'phone',
  'signature', 'profile_picture'
));
```

**006_add_conditional_question_logic.sql**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE application_questions
ADD COLUMN show_if_question_id UUID REFERENCES application_questions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
ADD COLUMN show_if_answer TEXT;

CREATE INDEX idx_questions_show_if ON application_questions(show_if_question_id);
```

### Important Implementation Notes

**Conditional Required Questions**:
- Questions can be marked as **required** AND have conditional logic
- The backend intelligently evaluates conditional logic when calculating completion percentage
- Required questions that are hidden (condition is false) do NOT count toward completion
- This ensures users can reach 100% completion even if conditional required questions never appear

**Example Scenario**:
1. Question A: "Does parent live at different address?" (dropdown: Yes/No)
2. Question B: "Parent's street address" (text, **required**, shows if A = "Yes")
3. If user selects "No" ‚Üí Question B never appears and doesn't block completion
4. If user selects "Yes" ‚Üí Question B appears and MUST be answered to complete

**Implementation**: Both `calculate_completion_percentage()` and `get_application_progress()` evaluate conditional logic by:
1. Fetching all user responses
2. For each question with `show_if_question_id`, checking if the trigger response matches `show_if_answer`
3. Only counting required questions that would actually be visible to the user
