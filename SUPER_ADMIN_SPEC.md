# CAMP FASD Application Portal - Super Admin Specification

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Purpose**: Complete specification of super admin capabilities and controls

---

## üéØ Super Admin Philosophy

The super admin (yianni@fasdcamp.org) has **complete system control** and acts as the system architect. They can:
- Manage all users and their permissions
- Configure the application structure (sections, questions)
- Modify system settings (fees, dates, email templates)
- Override any workflow state
- View all system data and analytics
- Audit all system activity

**Key Principle**: Super admin should be able to configure EVERYTHING without touching code or database directly.
