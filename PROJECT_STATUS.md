## ⚠️ Important Workflow Clarifications

### Application Status Flow (CORRECTED)
```
in_progress (< 100%)
  → under_review (100% complete, auto-transition)
  → [3 approvals from 3 teams] → Accept button ENABLED
  → accepted (admin/super_admin clicks Accept button manually)
  → [new conditional sections appear, progress recalculates]
  → [family completes new sections]
  → paid (after Stripe payment)
```

### Key Rules
1. **3 Approvals ≠ Auto-Accept**: Approvals only enable the Accept button. An admin must manually click.
2. **No Application Locking**: Families can edit applications at ANY time before "accepted" status.
3. **Conditional Questions**: Some sections/questions only appear after acceptance (show_when_status = "accepted").
4. **Progress Recalculation**: When accepted, progress % drops and recalculates to include new conditional questions.
5. **Google OAuth Auto-Admin**: Any @fasdcamp.org email = automatic admin role.
6. **Super Admin**: yianni@fasdcamp.org only. Can manage all users, see all teams, view invoice dashboard.

## 📝 Technical Decisions & Notes

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI (chosen for automatic API docs, type safety, and performance)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (for complex queries and relationships)
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2 (type-safe request/response validation)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
  - **Note**: Switched from passlib to direct bcrypt due to compatibility issues
- **Package Manager**: uv (faster than pip, requested by user)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CAMP utilities
- **State Management**: React Context API for auth
- **Data Fetching**: Native fetch with async/await
- **Forms**: Controlled components with local state

### Database Design
- **Host**: Supabase Cloud (managed PostgreSQL)
- **Schema**: 12 tables with proper relationships and indexes
- **Question Options**: Stored as JSON arrays in database (not dictionaries)
  - Example: `['Yes', 'No', 'Maybe']` 
  - Pydantic schema updated to accept `Union[List[str], Dict[str, Any]]`
- **Progress Calculation**: Based on required questions answered per section

### Autosave Pattern
- **Debounce**: 3 seconds after last user input
- **Strategy**: Batch all response changes, send single PATCH request
- **Progress**: Recalculates after each save
- **UI Feedback**: Shows "Saving..." indicator during save

## 🐛 Known Issues Log

### Fixed Issues
1. ✅ **Bcrypt/Passlib Compatibility** (Oct 17)
   - Error: `ValueError: password cannot be longer than 72 bytes`
   - Fix: Removed passlib, using bcrypt directly

2. ✅ **Dashboard 404 on Initial Load** (Oct 17)
   - Error: Missing `frontend/app/page.tsx`
   - Fix: Created landing page

3. ✅ **Pydantic Validation Error for Question Options** (Oct 17)
   - Error: Expected dict, received array
   - Fix: Updated schema to `Union[List[str], Dict[str, Any]]`

4. ✅ **Data Persistence Issue - Responses Not Loading** (Oct 17)
   - Error: Application wizard not loading saved responses on page refresh
   - Root Cause: Frontend only loaded sections/progress but never fetched existing responses
   - Fix: Added `ApplicationWithResponses` interface, updated `getApplication()` to load responses, transformed response array to map format in wizard

### Active Issues
1. 🟡 **Duplicate Questions in Application Sections**
   - Status: Investigating database seed data
   - Example: "Has your family previously attended CAMP FASD?" appears twice

---

## 📝 Latest Session Notes (File Upload Implementation)

### What Was Done This Session
1. ✅ **Created File Upload API Client** (`frontend/lib/api-files.ts`)
   - `uploadFile()` - Upload files with FormData
   - `getFile()` - Get file metadata and signed URL
   - `deleteFile()` - Delete uploaded files
   - Full TypeScript interfaces for type safety

   - Updated `upload_file()` to accept both bytes and BinaryIO
   - Fixed linter errors (removed unused imports)
   - Added proper type hints with Union types

4. ✅ **Hardened Supabase Storage Integration**
   - Added explicit bucket provisioning with descriptive error handling
   - Required service-role credentials for storage operations
   - Normalized upload payloads and ensured retry logic works after bucket creation
   - Added logging-friendly error messages to help future debugging

5. ✅ **Application Submission Workflow** (`backend/app/api/applications.py`, `frontend/app/dashboard/application/[id]/page.tsx`, `frontend/lib/api-applications.ts`)
   - Added authenticated submit endpoint enforcing 100% completion
   - Persist submission timestamp and move status to `under_review`
   - Wizard saves latest responses before submission and redirects to dashboard

6. ✅ **File Upload Features**
   - Drag and drop upload area
   - Click to upload functionality
   - Upload progress indicator with spinner
   - File display with filename and size
   - View file button (opens in new tab)
   - Remove file button with confirmation
   - File persistence across page refreshes
   - Automatic progress tracking updates

### Technical Implementation Details
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage with signed URLs (1 year expiration)
- **File Organization**: `applications/{application_id}/{question_id}/{filename}`
- **File Validation**: Type (PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG) and size (max 10MB)
- **Database Integration**: Files linked to ApplicationResponse via file_id
- **Metadata Tracking**: Files now record uploader ID and section label for easier admin review
- **Security**: User authentication required, ownership validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages, rollback on failure
- **Operations Note**: Backend must use Supabase service-role key; anon key cannot create buckets

### Testing Checklist

## 📝 Latest Session Notes (October 19, 2025 - Admin Workflow Enhancements)

### What Was Done This Session
1. ✅ **Enhanced Admin Applications Table**
   - Added "Approvals" column showing count and team badges
   - Removed "Completed" column
   - Replaced single "View Details" button with dual buttons:
     - View button with eye emoji (👁️)
     - Accept button (disabled until 3 approvals)
   - Backend now calculates and returns `approval_count` and `approved_by_teams`

2. ✅ **Implemented Inline Field Editing for Admins**
   - Created admin update endpoint: `PATCH /api/admin/applications/{id}`
   - Added hover-to-show edit button on all text responses
   - Textarea editor with Save/Cancel functionality
   - Real-time state updates on save

3. ✅ **Fixed File Viewing/Download Issues**
   - Added file error state tracking (`fileErrors` map)
   - Sequential file loading instead of parallel
   - Progressive state updates as each file loads
   - Clear error messages when files fail to load
   - Removed confusing "Loading file... (ID: xxx)" state

4. ✅ **Verified Name Display Throughout App**
