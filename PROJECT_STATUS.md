- **✅ COMPLETED: File upload system** - Full end-to-end file upload/download/delete functionality
- **✅ COMPLETED: File persistence fix** - Files now properly persist on page reload (db.flush() fix)
- **✅ COMPLETED: Submit functionality removed** - Applications auto-transition to "under_review" at 100% completion
- **✅ COMPLETED: Mobile-responsive design** - Collapsible sidebar, touch-friendly inputs, responsive layout

**Known Issues**:

## 🚧 Current Issues & Blockers

### Issue 1: Application Wizard Loading Sections
**Status**: Fix Applied, Needs Testing
**Description**: When accessing `/dashboard/application/[id]`, the wizard shows "Section 1 of 0" with no questions or sections loaded.

**Root Cause**: Pydantic schema validation error - backend expected `options` to be a dictionary but database stores it as an array (e.g., `['Yes', 'No']`).

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated `backend/app/schemas/application.py`:
  ```python
  options: Optional[Union[List[str], Dict[str, Any]]] = None
  validation_rules: Optional[Union[List[Any], Dict[str, Any]]] = None
  ```
- ✅ Updated `frontend/lib/api-applications.ts`:
  ```typescript
  options: string[] | Record<string, any> | null
  ```
- ✅ Backend reloaded 3 times after fix

**Next Step**: User needs to **hard refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R) to test if sections now load properly.

### Medium Priority
4. **Implement Approval Workflow**
   - Add approve/decline endpoints
   - Create admin notes functionality
   - Build three-team approval UI
   - Email notifications on approval/decline

5. **Stripe Payment Integration**

## 📝 Technical Decisions & Notes

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI (chosen for automatic API docs, type safety, and performance)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (for complex queries and relationships)
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2 (type-safe request/response validation)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
  - **Note**: Switched from passlib to direct bcrypt due to compatibility issues
- **Package Manager**: uv (faster than pip, requested by user)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CAMP utilities
- **State Management**: React Context API for auth
- **Data Fetching**: Native fetch with async/await
- **Forms**: Controlled components with local state

### Database Design
- **Host**: Supabase Cloud (managed PostgreSQL)
- **Schema**: 12 tables with proper relationships and indexes
- **Question Options**: Stored as JSON arrays in database (not dictionaries)
  - Example: `['Yes', 'No', 'Maybe']` 
  - Pydantic schema updated to accept `Union[List[str], Dict[str, Any]]`
- **Progress Calculation**: Based on required questions answered per section

### Autosave Pattern
- **Debounce**: 3 seconds after last user input
- **Strategy**: Batch all response changes, send single PATCH request
- **Progress**: Recalculates after each save
- **UI Feedback**: Shows "Saving..." indicator during save

## 🐛 Known Issues Log

### Fixed Issues
1. ✅ **Bcrypt/Passlib Compatibility** (Oct 17)
   - Error: `ValueError: password cannot be longer than 72 bytes`
   - Fix: Removed passlib, using bcrypt directly

2. ✅ **Dashboard 404 on Initial Load** (Oct 17)
   - Error: Missing `frontend/app/page.tsx`
   - Fix: Created landing page

3. ✅ **Pydantic Validation Error for Question Options** (Oct 17)
   - Error: Expected dict, received array
   - Fix: Updated schema to `Union[List[str], Dict[str, Any]]`

4. ✅ **Data Persistence Issue - Responses Not Loading** (Oct 17)
   - Error: Application wizard not loading saved responses on page refresh
   - Root Cause: Frontend only loaded sections/progress but never fetched existing responses
   - Fix: Added `ApplicationWithResponses` interface, updated `getApplication()` to load responses, transformed response array to map format in wizard

### Active Issues
1. 🟡 **Duplicate Questions in Application Sections**
   - Status: Investigating database seed data
   - Example: "Has your family previously attended CAMP FASD?" appears twice

## 📝 Latest Session Notes (File Upload Implementation)

### What Was Done This Session
1. ✅ **Created File Upload API Client** (`frontend/lib/api-files.ts`)
   - `uploadFile()` - Upload files with FormData
   - `getFile()` - Get file metadata and signed URL
   - `deleteFile()` - Delete uploaded files
   - Full TypeScript interfaces for type safety

2. ✅ **Enhanced Application Wizard** (`frontend/app/dashboard/application/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Added state management for uploaded files
   - Added state management for upload progress
   - Integrated file upload handlers
   - Added file display UI with view/delete functionality
   - Implemented file loading on application load
   - Added upload progress indicators

3. ✅ **Fixed Backend Storage Service** (`backend/app/services/storage_service.py`)
   - Updated `upload_file()` to accept both bytes and BinaryIO
   - Fixed linter errors (removed unused imports)
   - Added proper type hints with Union types

4. ✅ **Hardened Supabase Storage Integration**
   - Added explicit bucket provisioning with descriptive error handling
   - Required service-role credentials for storage operations
   - Normalized upload payloads and ensured retry logic works after bucket creation
   - Added logging-friendly error messages to help future debugging

5. ✅ **Application Submission Workflow** (`backend/app/api/applications.py`, `frontend/app/dashboard/application/[id]/page.tsx`, `frontend/lib/api-applications.ts`)
   - Added authenticated submit endpoint enforcing 100% completion
   - Persist submission timestamp and move status to `under_review`
   - Wizard saves latest responses before submission and redirects to dashboard

6. ✅ **File Upload Features**
   - Drag and drop upload area
   - Click to upload functionality
   - Upload progress indicator with spinner
   - File display with filename and size
   - View file button (opens in new tab)
   - Remove file button with confirmation
   - File persistence across page refreshes
   - Automatic progress tracking updates

### Technical Implementation Details
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage with signed URLs (1 year expiration)
- **File Organization**: `applications/{application_id}/{question_id}/{filename}`
- **File Validation**: Type (PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG) and size (max 10MB)
- **Database Integration**: Files linked to ApplicationResponse via file_id
- **Metadata Tracking**: Files now record uploader ID and section label for easier admin review
- **Security**: User authentication required, ownership validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages, rollback on failure
- **Operations Note**: Backend must use Supabase service-role key; anon key cannot create buckets

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Upload a PDF file
- [ ] Upload an image file
- [ ] View uploaded file
- [ ] Delete uploaded file
- [ ] Refresh page and verify file persists
- [ ] Test file size validation (try > 10MB)
- [ ] Test file type validation (try .txt file)
- [ ] Verify progress tracking updates after upload
- [ ] Test multiple file uploads in different sections
- [ ] Submit completed application and confirm dashboard redirect/status update

### Next Steps
1. Test file upload functionality end-to-end (image upload, view/delete, validation scenarios)
2. Build admin dashboard to view uploaded files
3. Add submission confirmation email and dashboard success messaging
