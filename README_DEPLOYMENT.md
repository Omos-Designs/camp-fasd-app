## 🔗 Final URLs

After deployment, you'll have these URLs:

1. **Application Portal** (Frontend)
   - Railway: `https://camp-fasd-app-production.up.railway.app`
   - This is what you'll link to from Squarespace

2. **API Backend**
   - Railway: `https://camp-fasd-backend-production.up.railway.app`
   - Users won't see this directly

3. **Squarespace Site** (Unchanged)
   - URL: `https://fasdcamp.org`
   - Add a button/link that points to the Railway frontend URL

## 💰 Cost Estimate

**Railway Hosting**:
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month per developer + usage
